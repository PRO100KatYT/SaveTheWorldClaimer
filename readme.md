# Fortnite Save the World Research Points & free Llama Claimer

This program allows you to claim Research Points, open free Llamas and even skip the tutorial mission without opening the game.

NOTE: Due to Epic Games removing the Daily Reward system from Fortnite, the program is no longer able to claim these rewards. Read more [here](https://www.fortnite.com/news/changes-coming-to-fortnite-save-the-worlds-daily-reward-system-in-v25-10).

### How to use it?
- Install `Python 3.9.5` or newer.

- If you didn't do it yet, the program will try to automatically install the `requests` module. If the program fails to do it, install it using the `pip install requests` console command.

- After starting the SaveTheWorldClaimer.py for the first time (or after deleting the config.ini file) you will be asked if you want to start the config setup process (recommended) or use the default config values. If you want to start the setup, type 1, if no, type 2.

- Next, you will be asked if you are logged into your Epic account in your browser. If yes, type 1, if no, type 2.

- After you'll press ENTER, an Epic Games website will open. From there, login if you are not already logged into your Epic account.

- Then a page should open with content similar to this:

```json
{"redirectUrl":"https://localhost/launcher/authorized?code=930884289b5852842271e9027376a527","authorizationCode":"930884289b5852842271e9027376a527","sid":null}
```
or this:
```json
{"redirectUrl":"com.epicgames.fortnite://fnauth/?code=930884289b5852842271e9027376a527","authorizationCode":"930884289b5852842271e9027376a527","sid":null}
```

- Copy the code (e.g. 930884289b5852842271e9027376a527), paste it into the program and press enter.

- If all went well, the program will say it has generated the auth.json file successfully.

- Now the program will proceed to work.

- Congratulations! You just got your today's Daily Quest, claimed Research Points and opened free Llamas if they were available!

- Next time you launch the program, to start claiming rewards, type 1 and press ENTER. You will not need to enter a new auth code because the login credentials have been saved in the auth.json file.
