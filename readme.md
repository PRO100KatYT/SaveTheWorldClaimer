### 🔄 Changelog:
**What's new in the `1.14.3` update:**
- 🎁 New feature: Winterfest event presents claiming!
  - Because Epic Games decided to make Winterfest presents not stack this year, I decided to rewrite my WinterfestPresentsOpener program functionality and include it in SaveTheWorldClaimer.
  - This feature is turned off by default. You can enable it by setting the `Claim_Winterfest_Presents` option to true in config.ini.
- 👋 Added some seasonal greetings when entering the Main Menu.
- ⚙️ Updated the Epic Games domains in certain URLs.
- 🎨 Tweaked the program's code a little bit.

### 🚀 How to use it?
1.  Install **Python 3.9.5** or a newer version.

2.  The program will try to automatically install the `requests` module. If it fails, open your console/terminal and install it manually using the command: `pip install requests`.

3.  When you start `SaveTheWorldClaimer.py` for the first time (or after deleting `config.ini`), you will be asked to start the config setup. It's recommended to do so.

4.  Next, the program will ask if you are logged into your Epic account in your default web browser.

5.  An Epic Games website will open. Log in if you haven't already.

6.  A page should then open with content similar to this:
    ```json
    {"redirectUrl":"https://localhost/launcher/authorized?code=930884289b5852842271e9027376a527","authorizationCode":"930884289b5852842271e9027376a527","sid":null}
    ```
    or this:
    ```json
    {"redirectUrl":"com.epicgames.fortnite://fnauth/?code=930884289b5852842271e9027376a527","authorizationCode":"930884289b5852842271e9027376a527","sid":null}
    ```

7.  ➡️ Copy the `authorizationCode` (e.g., `930884289b5852842271e9027376a527`), paste it into the program, and press ENTER.

8.  ✅ If everything went well, the program will confirm that the `auth.json` file was generated successfully. The program will then proceed to the Main Menu.

9.  🎉 Congratulations! You can now get your daily quest, open free llamas (if available), and much more!

10. The next time you launch the program, you won't need a new authorization code, as your login credentials are saved in `auth.json`.

### 🔔 Want notifications for free llamas?
I recommend joining [the r/FORTnITE discord server](https://discord.gg/PjqZaDmV8D "Here is the link :D") and assigning yourself the `freellamas` role. Alternatively, you can set the program to loop every 60 minutes to ensure you won't miss them when they appear in the llama shop.
